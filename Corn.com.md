# --Corn.com--

I wanted to create a site dedicated to my deep love of corn. The idea was to present it as a large company working across many sectors, that all encorperate corn.

I used a combination of lecture notes, youtube tutorials, and w3schools.com to learn html tags and techniques; ultimately deciding on using layered tables to build up the page.

### Notes

I used a single line CSS command to remove the table border around the site, as I was unable to reduce the border size enough using only HTML.

Further notes can be found as comments in index.html
