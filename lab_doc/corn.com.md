    Hi, Welcome To Corn.com

--About--

    I am Milo Curran, founder & CEO of Corn.com.

    I built this company from the ground up, with nothing but my own two hands, and a small donation of Â£4,000,000 from my father.

    Despite my evident success from Corn.com, I am still looking for collaborators and opportunities to create - please feel free to download my CV and share it with your friends & family :
